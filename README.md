# Overview
For this project, I decided to create my own Tic-Tac-Toe game using JavaScript for the behavior with the user, HTML for the structure of the game and webpage, and CSS for the styling. The Tic-Tac-Toe JavaScript code checks for wind conditions, listens for user interaction (such as clicking), has buttons for resetting the board, and switches between the players. 

I developed this Tic-Tac-Toe game primarily to deepen my understanding of JavaScript and its mechanics. Through this project, I aimed to learn JavaScript syntax, learn about its various functionalities, and become more comfortable with the language overall. By implementing the game logic, handling user interactions, and dynamically updating the HTML and CSS elements, I learned how to leverage JavaScript's capabilities to create interactive and engaging web applications. This project provided hands-on experience in problem-solving, logic implementation, and debugging. Additionally, it allowed me to explore concepts such as event handling, DOM manipulation, and conditional statements in a practical context, further solidifying my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals. Overall, developing this Tic-Tac-Toe game served as an invaluable learning experience that not only enhanced my JavaScript skills but also deepened my appreciation for web development as a whole.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

To develop this project I used Visual Studio Code, Google Chrome as my web browser, HTML and CSS for web page design, and Github to publish and track the development of my code. 

The language explored and used is JavaScript for the game logic and user interaction.
